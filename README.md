# BASH - "Bash Automation for Simple Hacking"

This repository offers a modular and extensible configuration for establishing and managing a robust Bash environment, tailored for penetration testers but also useful to developers and system administrators. It encompasses a setup script to configure a customized BASH environment, utility scripts to assit in daily activities, environment configurations, and tools designed to enhance productivity and streamline workflows.

## Overview

The **BASH_SETUP Environment** is designed to:
- Establish a structured, organized Bash environment.
- Automate penetration testing workflows.
- Provide utility scripts for system administration and development tasks.
- Enable dynamic, interactive menus for streamlined operations.
- Facilitate modular customization with extensive logging and error handling.

---

## Features

- **Dynamic Menus**:
  - FZF-powered menus for quick access to tools and scripts.
  - Persistent tracking of menu selections and timestamps.

- **Predefined Utilities**:
  - [Logging](docs/LOGGING_README.md) and error-handling utilities.
  - Modular scripts for common pentesting tasks.

- **Custom Environment Setup**:
  - Configurable `.bashrc`, `.bash_aliases`, and `.tmux.conf`.
  - Tailored prompts, aliases, and environment variables.

- **Modular Configuration System**:
  - `dot/`: Environment-specific configurations that get copied into the user's environment, primarily into `~/` or `~/.config/bash` directories. Files are renamed from `filename` to `.filename`.
  - `config/`: Additional configurations used by `SetupBashEnv.sh`. The `pentest.*` files are moved to `~/.config/pentest/` for use during penetration tests.
  - `lib/`: Utility scripts facilitating specific functionalities based on tasks such as apt, fzf, python, ruby, files, etc.

- **Tool Integrations**:
  - Scripts for popular tools like Aquatone, Nuclei, and more.
  - Preconfigured modules for reconnaissance, exploitation, and credential testing.

- **Automation Scripts**:
  - `tools/`: Modules for external tools installed in `${TOOLS_DIR}` (typically `~/DATA/TOOLS/`).
    - `config/`: Custom config files for specific tools, copied into appropriate directories during installation.
    - `modules/`: Scripts designed to install individual tools, ensuring proper setup, necessary aliases, and virtual environments if needed.
    - `extra/`: Miscellaneous additional tools.
      - `msf/`: Various `.rc` files for Metasploit, each executing a specific module and logging output.
      - `scripts/`: Custom in-house standalone tools.

- **Pentest Menu**:
  - `pentest_menu/`: Pentest menu scripts (currently a work in progress and subject to change).

- **Documentation**:
  - `docs/`: Documentation for various scripts, primarily those in the `lib/` directory.

- **Testing**:
  - `tests/`: Automated tests to ensure code quality and functionality.

---

## Requirements

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu or a similar Linux distribution.
- **Dependencies**:
  - `bash` (>=4.0)
  - `fzf` (for interactive menus)
  - Standard Linux utilities (`curl`, `git`, `tmux`, etc.)
  -
  - Misc tools that make your life easier: ncat eza bat/batcat proxychains4

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tatanus/BASH.git
   cd BASH
   ```

2. Run the setup script:

   ```

3. Restart your shell or source the environment:
   ```bash
   # if your system does not automatically source ~/.bashrc you will need to do it manually
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

## ðŸ’¡ **Usage Notes**
- Environment variables should be set dynamically in scripts to avoid hardcoding paths.
- Subdirectories are logically grouped to improve organization and efficiency during assessments.
- The `OUTPUT/` directory is used to store pre/post-processing results from tools and automated scripts.
- The `LOOT/` directory is strictly for collected artifacts, while `RECON/` is for analyzed and colleded data.
